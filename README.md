# About
A GitHub repository dedicated to the hidden source files from Petroglyph's hit game, _Empire at War_! **It is imperative that you know how to mod the game beforehand**.

# Contains
The entire repo is "split" up into 2 different sections. One for the EAW base game and one for the 2006 Forces of Corruption DLC. Each contain the confidential source code from the appropariate game. XML, LUA, and shaders are all there. It is **NOT** recommended that you just copy and paste this and call it a new mod! The shaders folder may cause crashes and you'll need the "Text" + "Art" folder for maximum modding. Without them, you won't be able to modify the game's strings nor the models/textures.

# Disclaimer
All of these files are directly from the game via the map editor (which creates a "Source" folder upon installation). These files were created by the Petroglyph development team (not me). Meaning, I'm not responsible for any damages done to your mod or game if something goes wrong! Make sure to create backups before modding the game!
