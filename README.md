# About
A GitHub repository dedicated to the hidden source files from Petroglyph's hit game, _Empire at War_!

# Disclaimer
All of these files are directly from the game via the map editor (which creates a "Source" folder upon installation). These files were created by the Petroglyph development team (not me). Meaning, I'm not responsible for any damages done to your mod or game if something goes wrong! Make sure to create backups before modding the game!
